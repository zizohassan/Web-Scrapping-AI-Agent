# Web Scraping AI Agent

This project is a Streamlit application that allows you to scrape a website using the OpenAI API. The application leverages the `SmartScraperGraph` from the `scrapegraphai.graphs` module to perform the scraping based on user input.

## Features

- **User Input for URL**: Enter the URL of the website you want to scrape.
- **User Prompt**: Specify what you want the AI agent to scrape from the website.
- **Scraping**: Click the "Scrape" button to initiate the scraping process.
- **Results Display**: The scraped results are displayed on the Streamlit app.

## Configuration

The application is configured to use the following models from Ollama:
- **Language Model**: `ollama/llama3.1`
- **Embeddings Model**: `ollama/nomic-embed-text`

Both models are set to use the base URL `http://localhost:11434`.
